# 3ds-Max-Batch-Import-Export-Tool
3ds Max batch import, modify &amp; export tool

## Description
A 3ds Max Maxscript tool for batch importing models, making modifications and then mass exporting them.
This Maxscript is a modified version of Jos Balcaen's Batch Import/Export which was distributed as an encrypted file, limiting it to being used with it's bugs and without some quality of life features or an ability to add more functionality.

It was decrypted by me using [MSE Decrypt](https://github.com/joshaxey/MSE-Decrypt) which I made for this purpose, it was then modified to be more functional, and so that it can live on decrypted and be modified by others.

This Maxscript saves a stupid amount of hours of work. A __stupid__ amount.
